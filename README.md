# TrackerforPI

## The goal of the project is to create a Live Image/Video tracker using OpenCV to use a Raspberry PI camera, or a laptop camera to see and track moving objects. 

The camera will be constantly watching the surroundings. It will use OpenCV libraries to track any items that show up in its visual. 

Future Goals for the project: 
- Add support for detecting the tracked item (Human, or Cat). 
- If an item comes into the view, log its time and date.
- Contact the owner, by text or email at the end of the day, with logs, images etc.

## More to ba added here as project grows.
